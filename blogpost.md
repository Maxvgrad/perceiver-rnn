# The Rally Estonia Challenge 2024
**Project members:** Maksim Ploter, Gordei Prib√µtkin, Filips Petuhovs, Rain Eichhorn
## Introduction 
This project is a venture into developing a model for autonomous steering for a self-driving task. The challenge for autonomous vehicle is navigating rural roads in Estonia at moderate speed (15-35 km/h), without traffic. In this project we experiment with *two-three?* deep-learning architectures and report our results.  

## Methods
### Dataset and preprocessing
The dataset contains the cropped and antialiased images from the frontal camera of the vehicle. The resolution of the images is 68x264 pixels. *Preprocessing info goes here...* Our initial experiments are preformed without any augmentation. 

### Metrics
For the evaluation of the model we use the VISTA simulation. 

### Baseline 
For the baseline model we're using the PilotNet implementaiton introduced in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316. We keep the architecutre uchanged.
